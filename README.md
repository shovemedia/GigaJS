GigaJS
======

HTML5 site engine based on the GAIA Flash Framework 

Giga leverages the following fine libraries:
require.js — All JS in Giga is wrapped as an AMD module.
almond.js — optimized builds are built with the require.js optimizer and include
  
History.js — as GAIA used SWFAddress, Giga uses History.js
Q.js — Promises implementation
signals.js — "Event" dispatching
Greensock tweening — GAIA used Greensock (ActionScript) , Giga uses Greensock (JavaScript)
JQuery / Zepto — This dependency will eventually be removed
